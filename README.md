## Rebrickable Tool

> A tool for the rebrickable website (www.rebrickable.com) to do some things that it doesn't do/


## Getting Started

Go to the site https://rebrickable-tool.firebaseapp.com

## developers
You can checkout the code and see what little work you have to do in polymer to create this site.
It uses polymer-cli so you will need to install that to run it.

## Licensing

Like other projects, Rebrickable Tool includes Google license headers at the top of several of our source files. Google's open-source licensing requires that this header be kept in place (sorry!), however we acknowledge that you may need to add your own licensing to files you modify. This can be done by appending your own extensions to these headers.

## Contributing

Rebrickable Tool is a new project and is an ongoing effort by the Web Component community. We welcome your bug reports, PRs for improvements, docs and anything you think would improve the experience for other Polymer developers.
